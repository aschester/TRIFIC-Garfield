Garfield++ simulations for TRIFIC. 

Use gasTable to make gas file. Hardcoded for CF4 with configurable field range and sensitivity. This takes a very long time to run.

trific outputs field maps and drift lines using RKF numerical integration. Also fairly slow especially for heavy ions with lots of electrons. Can control speed with drift percentage. Signal calculations unreliable.
